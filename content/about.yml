  Hi, I’m **Thomas GRAND**, a Full-Stack Developer from Lyon with experience building modern web interfaces, workflow automation systems, and AI-assisted tools.  
  I enjoy transforming complex requirements into clean, efficient and maintainable applications that scale well in real production environments.

  My journey started with a strong foundation in engineering and technology, studying at **EPITECH Lyon**, followed by a full academic year at **Université Laval (Québec)**. Throughout my career, I've worked across multiple industries — tech consulting, R&D, pharmaceutical tooling, and IT — giving me a practical understanding of how digital systems operate in real organizations.

  ### What I Do

  I specialize in:
  - **Front-end architecture** using Vue, Nuxt and modern TypeScript  
  - **Automation & AI-assisted workflows** using n8n and custom agents  
  - **Back-end development** with Node.js, PHP/Symfony, and internal tools  
  - **Technical refactoring & clean code practices**  
  - **Problem-solving at scale**, especially in large teams and complex environments  

  I value clarity, structure and reliability. I enjoy designing systems that feel simple on the surface, but are built on solid technical foundations.

  ### Professional Background

  At **Steamulo**, I work as a full-stack developer on major public platforms and internal automation systems.  
  My responsibilities include:
  - Leading front-end refactors (INPI — Guichet Unique)  
  - Migrating large Vue/Nuxt codebases (Team France Export)  
  - Building AI assistants for operational teams  
  - Designing automation pipelines integrated with Trello, Jira, Outlook, NetExplorer and other third-party tools  

  Before that, I worked at **AVA UX** on Unity-based 3D development and R&D prototypes, including real-time interaction systems and mesh rendering.

  I also gained strong engineering experience at **LASA** (WordPress maintenance & IT support) and **Skyepharma** (WinDev internal tools, maintenance, automation scripts).

  ### Personal Projects

  I’m the creator of **AngleGuessr** — an angle-estimation browser game available at  
  **https://angleguessr.xyz**  

  I frequently experiment with new technologies, AI workflows, and tools that improve developer experience.

  ### Beyond Coding

  Outside of development, I enjoy fitness, exploring digital creation, and working on personal side projects that let me test new ideas.

  Thanks for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or discuss a project.
