title: AngleGuessr — Technical Browser Game
description: |
  Built AngleGuessr, a fast-paced browser game that challenges users to estimate angles with precision.  
  Developed the complete logic engine (angle generation, tolerance calculation, scoring), the state management system, and a fully client-side architecture optimized for responsiveness.  
  Implemented a custom rendering pipeline using HTML Canvas for real-time visual feedback and smooth interaction loops.
